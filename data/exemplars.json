    "text": "Ad Brief for 'Cat-Proof Blinds'\n\nNorth Star: Finally, blinds your cat can't destroy (probably).\n\nFunny Mechanism: The cat is a tiny, fluffy Bond villain, and the blinds are its nemesis.\n\nBeat Sheet:\n1. Open on a beautiful, sunlit room, utterly destroyed. Shredded curtains, knocked-over plants.\n2. A homeowner installs the new, sleek 'Cat-Proof Blinds'. They look confident.\n3. The cat enters, sizes up the blinds, and begins a series of comically elaborate and failed attempts to destroy them (e.g., using tiny grappling hooks, trying to karate chop them).\n4. Final shot: The cat, defeated, sits glaring at the pristine blinds. The homeowner sips tea peacefully.\n\nHook: 'Tired of your cat redecorating?'"
